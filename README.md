# True Walking for Combat Robotics

Semi-automating walking functions needed to operate a 2DOF true walker, using arduino as an interface between servo and receiver.

Foward, backwards, left, right movement functions. Invertible function planned but not created.

1. Assign pins to channels
2. Set angle defaults and ranges
3. Build and upload to Arduino Pro Mini
